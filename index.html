                                                                I met a traveller from an antique land,
                                                                Who saidâ€”"Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
                                                                Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
                                                                Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
                                                                And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
                                                                Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
                                                                Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
                                                                The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
                                                                And on the pedestal, these words appear:



                                                                                                                        <small><i>'My name is <strong>Ozymandias</strong>, King of Kings;

                                <strong>Nothing beside remains.</strong>                                    
                                
                                
                                
                                                                                            Round the decay
                                                                Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
                                                                The lone and level sands stretch far away."
